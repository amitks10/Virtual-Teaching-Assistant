AAAS	[acronym]  American Association for the Advancement of Science, pronounced "Triple-A ess."$abiogenesis	[noun]  The emergence of life forms emerging from non-living chemical systems. In contrast with spontaneous generation, abiogenesis is not a process that biologists think continues in a particular environment, such as a planet or moon, once a living system has emerged.$absolute temperature	[noun]  A temperature scale with its units in Kelvin. A temperature in degrees Celsius can be converted to Kelvin by adding 273.15 to its value.$absolute zero	[noun]  The theoretical lowest temperature possible at which all molecular motion ceases.  Absolute zero, 0 K or -273.15Â°C, has never been reached.$absorb	[verb]  Take in or soak up (energy, liquids, or other substances), usually gradually, through a chemical or physical action.$abstract	[noun]  In science, an abstract is a brief statement of essential information contained within a document or presentation. An abstract is not an introduction, rather it concentrates the most pertinent information to facilitate understanding of the main points of the document. Most scientific journal articles include an abstract at the beginning of the article which is uploaded to literature databases to facilitate information searches; and scientists also submit abstracts that summarize what they will present at a scientific meeting. See this Writing@CSU page for additional information.$acceleration	[noun]  The change in an object's velocity over time, measured in distance per unit time per unit time (for example meters per second per second or m/s2). Compare to velocity. Acceleration (a) is calculated by dividing the change (symbolized by Δ, the Greek letter delta) in velocity (v) by the change in time (t):

a = Δv/ Δt.

This can also be written as: 

a = v2-v1/ t2-t1, where v1 and t1 denote the starting velocity and time and v2 and t2 denote the ending velocity and time.

To illustrate, imagine a car speeding up (accelerating) from a stand still (0 meters/second) to a speed of 15 meters/seconds over the course of 5 seconds. The car's total increase in velocity is 15 meters/second.  During each of the 5 seconds that the car is accelerating, its velocity increases by 3 meters/second until it reaches its top speed. (After one second the car is traveling at a velocity of 3 meters/second; after 2 seconds, it's traveling at a velocity of 6 meters/second, and so on). Therefore, the car's rate of acceleration is 3 meters per second per second or 3 m/s2. Using the equation above:

a = v2-v1/ t2-t1 
a = 15-0 / 5-0
a = 15/5
a = 3 m/s2$accuracy	[noun]  In science, the term accuracy describes how well a measurement approximates the theoretically correct value of that measurement, for example, how close an arrow strikes to the center of a target.

Also called 14C-dating or radiocarbon dating.$carbonic acid	[noun]  The weak acid formed when CO2 dissolves in water.$Carnot Cycle	[noun]  A theoretical formulation of the most efficient thermodynamic cycle capable of converting thermal energy into work, and work into thermal energy. A defining characteristic of the Carnot Cycle is that it does not consider a change in entropy, and thus cannot exist in real practice. Like the Third Law of Thermodynamics, the Carnot Cycle serves as a reference point in measuring efficiency and entropy in heat engines.$Carnot, Sadi	[person]  Physicist and military engineer, born in Paris, France (1796-1832). Carnot authored Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire in 1824, which provided the first account of the theoretical workings of heat engines.

His most famous book is Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously in 1844, in which he argues for transmutation, an evolutionary view of life similar to that proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, an unpopular view with both the scientific community and society in general. Charles Darwin credited Chambers with preparing people to accept the theory of evolution by natural selection.$Chapman, Sydney	[person]  British-American geophysicist and mathematician born in Eccles, Lancashire (1888-1970). In 1939, Chapman co-authored the classic work The Mathematical Theory of Non-Uniform Gases. The following year, he co-authored the two-volume work Geomagnetism.

Chargaff immigrated to the United States in 1935 and died in New York City in 2002.  He is best known for discovering two rules about DNA chemistry that significantly advanced the field of molecular biology.  Chargaff's First Rule is that the number of adenine base units in DNA is equal to that of thymine, and the number of cytosine base units is equal to that of guanine (A = T, C = G). This was an important clue for James Watson and Frances Crick as they worked on solving the molecular structure of DNA. The Second Rule is that the composition of DNA, in terms of the relative amount of A, T, G, and C bases, varies from species to species. This was significant evidence for Oswald Avery's hypothesis that DNA carries hereditary information.$charge	[noun]  A quantity of electricity.$Charles's Law	[noun]  The relationship between a gasâs volume (V) and its temperature (T), which was first observed by Jacques Charles. Charlesâs Law states that for a fixed amount of gas at a constant pressure, the gasâs volume increases linearly as its absolute temperature increases.$Charles, Jacques-Alexandre-CÃ©sar	[person]  A French scientist and hot-air balloonist, born in Beaugency, France (1746 â 1823). Charles invented and flew in the first hydrogen-filled balloon; while working with hot-air balloons, he observed in 1787 that a gasâs temperature and volume were linearly correlated. This relationship between temperature and volume was later named Charlesâs Law by the French scientist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac in 1801.$Chase, Martha	[person]  (1927 - August 8, 2003) Also known as Martha C. Epstein, an American geneticist and member of the team whose experiments showed that DNA, and not protein, comprises genetic material.

This often results in a circle, ellipse, or parabola.$conservation	[noun]  Careful use of natural resources to minimize waste or damage to the natural world and to maintain natural resources for long-term human use. Historically, conservation has been contrasted with preservation â a strategy of setting aside resources and wild areas for protection from human impacts. In common usage, though, conservation has come to mean any activity that protects or restores the natural environment.$conservation biology	[noun]  An interdisciplinary branch of science focused on understanding and maintaining Earth's biodiversity and the natural processes that create and sustain it. Conservation biologists study the impacts that humans have on biological diversity (variety) from the genetic level to the whole ecosystem level. They also develop practical ways to protect and restore that diversity.

While it has roots in the older field of ecology, conservation biology is a young scientific discipline. It emerged as its own recognized field of study in the 1980s, though wildlife managers in Australia and Europe had been using the term and practicing some of its tenets (principles) for several decades.

Biologist and founder of the Society for Conservation Biology Michael SoulÃ© wrote one of the first formal explanations of the field in his 1985 paper "What is conservation biology?" SoulÃ© and other early supporters called it a "crisis discipline" because it arose in response to concern over extinction and global loss of biodiversity.

At its core, conservation biology is an applied science with certain goals and values built into it. Like all scientists, conservation biologists seek knowledge about the natural world. But they also suggest ways to apply that knowledge to a real-world problem: biodiversity loss. 

Modern conservation biologists draw on wide-ranging disciplines like genetics, physiology, forestry, social science, and many others. They employ a number of tools and approaches in their efforts to study and protect biodiversity. Some of the most common are nature reserves designed to protect species and their habitats and captive breeding programs to help boost wild populations.

Conservation biologists fill many roles, including academic researchers, government wildlife managers and land use planners, breeders at zoos and aquaria, and scientists and advocates working for non-profit groups.

Continental crust ranges from 10-70 km thick and is composed primarily of granite.$continental drift	[noun]  The theory proposed in 1915 by Alfred Wegener, a German geophysicist and meteorologist. The theory stated that the continents had once been joined into one âsupercontinent,â called Pangaea. About 200 million years ago, Pangaea broke apart and the continents drifted to their present positions. Wegener based his theory on the similarity of fossils and rock types on the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa. The theory was widely ridiculed at the time because Wegener had not proposed a driving force for such drift.Â $control	[noun]  In science, a control is a system for which the expected change or outcome is well known and is measured or observed for the purpose of comparing it to a treatment group in scientific research. The control is used as a standard to compare or quantify change in the treatment.

There are two types of crust: continental and oceanic. Continental crust ranges from 10-70 km thick and has a composition approximating that of granite. Oceanic crust, on the other hand, is approximately 5 km thick and has a composition similar to basalt, making it significantly denser than continental crust.$crystal	[noun]  A solid of defined shape that is bound by plane surfaces (facets) that intersect at characteristic angles. The shape of a crystal is defined by the bonding and/or interaction between atoms, ions, or molecules that make up the solid. The substances, planar angles, and defects in a crystal affect the electrical and optical properties (including color) of the crystal.$crystalline	[adjective]  Having a regular, lattice-like arrangement of atoms or molecules. Crystalline solids melt at a precise melting point and break along specific planes and at specific angles defined by the crystalâs geometry.$crystallization	[noun]  The process through which crystals form, resulting in the change from a liquid or vapor to a solid. Crystallization can happen in two basic ways:

In the case that the wave source and observer are moving toward one another, the frequency of the observed waves increases and wavelength decreases. With sound, this would result in an increase in pitch. Conversely, for a wave source and observer moving away from one another, the wave frequency decreases and wavelength increases. With sound, this would result in a decrease in pitch. The Doppler Effect can be experienced with any wave form, including light (see redshift and blueshift).$Doppler, Christian	[person]  (aka Johann Christian Doppler) Mathematician and physicist, born in Salzburg, Austria (1803-1853).

He was also associated with the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the development of the atomic bomb. In 1999, Time magazine named Einstein "Person of the Century."$El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation	[noun]  A 2- to 7-year climatic cycle in the Tropical Pacific. In El NiÃ±o years, the trade winds die down, leading to a build-up of unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which results in increased rainfall in the southern United States and Peru and drought in Southeast Asia and Australia.$electrical charge	[noun]  A fundamental property used to explain attraction and repulsion between certain particles. Two types of charge exist: negative charge, which is generally conveyed as an excess of electrons, and positive charge, which is generally conveyed as a lack of electrons and excess of protons.  The interaction of opposite charges produces an attractive electrical force, and the interaction of like charges produces a repulsive electrical force.$electrical force	[noun]  A fundamental force produced by the interaction of electrical charges. Sometimes called the âelectromagneticâ force, electrical force is several billion times stronger than gravitational force.$electrolyte	[noun]  A substance that dissociates into 2 or more oppositely charged ions in water.

He is credited (by Aristotle) with inventing rhetoric, and by the philosopher Galen with founding the science of medicine. Empedocles is remembered for his belief that all matter was composed of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. He also proved experimentally that air was a substance, rather than empty space, and deduced that light travels at a finite velocity.$emulsion	[noun]  A well-dispersed mixture of two or more liquids that do not normally mix. Mayonnaise is an example of an emulsion.$endangered species list	[noun]  (Shorthand for the United States' "Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants") An official list of species that are at risk of going extinct. The US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintain the list and develop plans to help listed species recover by protecting them and their habitat.

Species fall in different categories depending on the urgency of their situation. A species that is officially endangered is on the brink of extinction. A threatened species is likely to be on the brink of extinction in the near future. A candidate species is one that has been studied and is being considered for listing.

Other countries and international bodies have similar designations. CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) has been signed by 175 countries to date. This cooperative agreement regulates trade of endangered plants and animals (and products made from them) in an effort to protect those species globally.$endemic	[adjective]  Natural or native to a particular location or region (usually referring to a species of plant or animal).

He is most famous for calculating the Earthâs circumference. This work began when Eratosthenes read from a papyrus scroll that in Syene (now called Aswan), a frontier town along the Upper Nile River, an object sticking up from the ground cast no shadow at noon on the longest day of the year. At that same time, the Sunâs rays shone directly down into a deep well, rather than hitting any side of the well. This meant that the sun was directly overhead, something that never happened in Alexandria. Eratosthenes hired someone to measure the precise distance to Syene. They found that it was roughly 800 km away. Using measurements of shadows of poles of standardized lengths at the two locations, Eratosthenes was able not only to prove that the Earth was a sphere, but also that the two cities differed by approximately 7.2 degrees of an arc, or 1/50th of a circle. Based on that, he calculated the Earthâs circumference to be 50 x 800 = 40,000 km, which is just about what we know it to be today (40,075 km)!$erosion	[noun]  The action or process of eroding: wearing away by the action of water, wind, glacial ice, etc.$estimation	[noun]  In statistics, estimation is the process by which population parameters are estimated based on subsample statistics. Scientists typically use two different types of estimates: point estimates and interval estimates. Point estimates use the value as a subsample statistic as a direct estimate for a population parameter. Interval estimates use subsample statistics to derive a range of values in which a population parameter is thought to lie. Interval estimates are particularly useful in that they reflect the uncertainty related to the estimation.$eugenics	[noun]  A social philosophy that advocates for the control of heritable characteristics in humans through various forms of intervention including selective breeding, sterilization, and others.$eukaryote	[noun]  A single- or multi-cellular organism whose cells contain a distinct nucleus that encloses the organism's genetic material.$eukaryotic	[adjective]  Of cells with a nucleus and other organelles that are surrounded by lipid membranes$eutrophic	[adjective]  A water body where the nutrient content (particularly phosphorus) is so high that quickly reproducing plants, like algae, form a thick mat on the surface of the water. This mat prevents sunlight from penetrating the water, which in turn prevents other aquatic plants from photosynthesizing. Over time, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water decreases and aquatic animals suffocate. A eutrophic water body is one where this process has been underway for some time.$eutrophication	[noun]  A process of excessive plant growth in a water body (usually phytoplankton) in response to an influx of nutrients. The excessive growth prevents sunlight from reaching other plants below the waterâs surface, which in turn prevents those plants from photosynthesizing. This change reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen available to the organisms living in the water body, causing suffocation. 

While the increase in nutrients that causes eutrophication can occur as a result of natural phenomena (e.g., a mudslide or atmospheric deposition), excess nutrients typically  come from human practices like farming (fertilizer runoff). Phosphorus and nitrogen are the main nutrients involved in eutrophication of water bodies.$evidence	[noun]  Support for an idea, opinion, or hypothesis.$evolution	[noun]  Change in the gene pool of a population from generation to generation by such processes as mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift.$excitable	[adjective]  A description of cells that are very sensitive to changes in voltage and the movement of ions.$excited state	[noun]  An energy state for an atom in which electrons exist above the minimum or ground state configuration.

Wood burning in the presence of oxygen is an example of an exothermic reaction.$experiment	[noun]  A test or trial carried out under controlled conditions so that specific actions can be performed and the results can be observed.$exponent	[noun]  A number or expression written superscript to another number or expression, called the base, and indicating the power to which the base number is to be raised. For example, bx, where b is the base number and x is the exponent. Positive integer exponents indicate the number of times a number or expression is used as a factor of repeated multiplication.$exponential decay	[noun]  A decrease in which the rate of growth of a value is proportionate to the previous decrease in value. The change that occurs when an each previous amount is decreased by multiplying by a consistent rate.$exponential growth	[noun]  An increase in which the rate of growth of a value is proportionate to the previous increase in value. The change that occurs when an each previous amount is increased by multiplying by a consistent rate.$extensive property	[noun]  A property of matter that is dependent on the amount of material present.

[general science] To make an estimate, form a hypothesis, or draw a conclusion about an unknown situation by applying trends seen or evidence discovered in a similar situation. For example, if scientists document that a certain species' population has declined in one area because of a rise in temperature, they may be able to extrapolate (or make a prediction) about how the species will respond to a rise in temperature in another location.$extreme science	[noun]  An approach to scientific research that is outside what is considered average, normal practice. This research approach includes projects like the Experimental Lakes Area, where researchers intentionally polluted a very large pristine lake to measure the effects of excess nutrients. In another example of extreme science, in 2013 a group of medical professionals accompanied 12 children (aged 8 to 16) from the United Kingdom on a climb of Mount Everest. The purpose of this trip was to research the effects of high altitude (low oxygen) on children and provide information on how human muscle responds to oxygen-deprivation.$extrusion	[noun]  A process by which viscous magma is emitted from below the surface of the Earth to cool on the surface.$facilitated diffusion	[noun]  Occurs when a channel assists molecules in moving through a membrane. For example, a sodium channel creates a path through the membrane for sodium ions to flow freely.$Fahrenheit, Daniel Gabriel	[person]  German physicist born in Danzig, Poland (1686-1736). Fahrenheit invented the alcohol thermometer in 1709, and the mercury thermometer in 1714.

Ferrel is best known for his contributions to describing and explaining circulation in what is now known as the Ferrel cell, which operates in the latitude bands between 30Â° and 60Â°. As a writer for a nautical almanac and scientist at the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Ferrel conducted extensive research on tides. He designed a machine to predict maximum and minimum tide heights and times, which was used by the survey from 1885 through the 1910s.$Feynman, Richard	[person]  American physicist, born in Queens, New York (1918-1988). Feynman is best known for his work on quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and particle theory. In 1965, he was the joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics (with Julian Schwinger and Shin-Ichiro Tomonaga) for his work on quantum electrodynamics. Feynman also worked on the Manhattan Project and participated on the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition, he published several popular semi-autobiographical books.$Fick, Adolf	[person]  German physicist and physiologist (1829-1901) born in Kassel, Germany.

The First Law explores the conservation of energy. Specifically, this law explains that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. It also states that the energy within a closed system is fixed â it cannot increase or decrease. The First Law is often expressed as an equation: ∆U = Q - W, or the change in internal energy (∆U) equals the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W).  See also the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Third Law of Thermodynamics.$Fisher, Ronald	[person]  English statistician, geneticist, and evolutionary biologist born in London (1890-1962). He is considered the father of modern statistics. In 1919, Fisher began working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station. Six years later, he published Statistical Methods for Research Workers, drawing on his experience in creating statistically valid experiments. In 1935, Fisher published The Design of Experiments. Both works are still considered standards in the field of statistics. Fisher also contributed extensively to understanding population genetics, and was a staunch promoter of eugenics.$Fixity of Species	[noun]  An idea popular among 16th and 17th century European zoologists and botanists that reflected Western religion and the story of creation as laid out in the Bible. A key feature of the argument for "fixity" was the notion that the structure of each species was based on a model, ideal form and never changed. With the publication of Darwin's and other scientists' work on evolution, the idea is no longer considered by scientists. For more information, see our module Charles Darwin I.$floodplain	[noun]  The relatively flat land adjacent to a river channel that is underwater when the river floods. The floodplain is the site of deposition of sediments carried down the river and are often occupied by farms, due to the proximity of irrigation water, fertile soils, and flat topography.$fluid	[adjective]  Able to flow because the intermolecular forces allow the molecules to move around in relation to one another. Both liquids and gases are fluid.$fluorescence	[noun]  The emission of light by a substance following the absorption of light or other energy by the substance.

Franklin was a prolific scientist and humanitarian. In Philadelphia, he founded America's first subscription library, the city hospital, and the American Philosophical Society. He was also an inventor, designing a heat-efficient stove, swim fins, and bifocals. His experiments with electricity and lightening brought him global recognition. In the political scene, he was elected to the continental congress, signed the Declaration of Independence, and â one of his last acts before dying â wrote an anti-slavery treatise.$Franklin, Rosalind	[person]  English biophysicist and X-ray crystallographer born in London (1920-1958). Franklin discovered that DNA crystallizes into two forms, and, working with Maurice Wilkins, used X-ray crystallography to determine the molecular structure of one of these forms. Her work was instrumental in allowing James Watson and Francis Crick to determine the complete structure of DNA. Her results were shared with them without her knowledge, and her contributions were not acknowledged. When Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won a Nobel Prize for their work on the structure of DNA in 1962, Franklin was again overlooked because the Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously.$frequency	[noun]  The rate at which a vibration occurs that constitutes a wave, either in a material or in an electromagnetic field, usually measured in hertz (Hz); a measure of how often a wave cycle is completed in a given unit of time.$gabbro	[noun]  A dark-colored intrusive igneous rock that consists mostly of the minerals plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine.

Both gabbro and basalt are mafic rocks, composed of minerals high in iron and magnesium.$Galileo Galilei	[person]  The Italian physicist, mathematician, and astronomer born in Pisa in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1564-1642 CE). Among other things, Galileo studied the acceleration of objects and discovered the four largest moons of the planet Jupiter. His work significantly advanced the use of quantitative experimentation in science, and he made noteworthy contributions in the development of technology: He invented the refracting telescope, perfected the compound microscope, and improved compass design. Galileo was famously jailed during the Inquisition for his support of Copernicus's heliocentric view of the cosmos.$gamete	[noun]  A reproductive cell having half the number of chromosomes (a haploid) of a mature cell, e.g., a sperm or egg cell.$gas	[noun]  The state of matter characterized by its non-condensed nature and ability to flow.

Unlike solids, gases do not have fixed shapes and take the shape of their container (as do liquids). Compare with liquid and solid.$gas constant	[noun]  A physical constant used in the ideal gas equation to relate a gasâs state to its pressure, volume, amount, and temperature. Given the symbol R, it was first defined by the German chemist August Horstmann in 1873.$gas laws	[noun]  A set of observed relationships between a gasâs pressure, absolute temperature, volume, and amount. The gas laws consist of Avogadroâs Law, Boyleâs Law, and Charlesâs Law.$gate	[noun]  Active ion channels can regulate the passage of ions via a gate mechanism.  Gates can open (allow ions to flow through) or close (restrict the flow of ions) depending on external signals.

If the temperature increases then the molecules will gain more energy and move faster.$Knight, Thomas Andrew	[person]  (1759-1838) An English horticulturalist and botanist. He conducted extensive breeding experiments with strawberries, cabbages, peas, and various kinds of fruit, with the goal of improving food plants by selectively breeding for better qualities. He also studied inheritance in peas and came to many of the same conclusions as Gregor Mendel, but did not formulate a theory to explain his observations. Knight served as president of the London Horticultural Society from 1811 to 1838. He is remembered for his devotion to improving the quality of food plants, and inspired generations of horticulturists to bend their efforts in that direction.$Krebs, Hans Adolf	[person]  1900â1981). One of thousands of scientists who fled Germany because of their Jewish heritage when the Nazis came to power, Krebs spent most of his career in England. He is best known for his discovery of the urea cycle and the citric acid cycle; the latter is also called the Krebs Cycle.$Lamarck, Jean Baptiste	[person]  French zoologist and botanist, born in Bazentine le Petit (1744-1829). While working as a professor of invertebrate natural history at the MusÃ©e National d'Histoire Naturelle, Lamarck developed his theory of evolution, which stated that organisms could change in response to changes in their environment and could pass these changes on to their offspring, a theory later proven largely incorrect.$landscape	[noun]  The natural scenery of a region; a collection of landforms in an area.$Landsteiner, Karl	[person]  (1868-1943) Austrian forensic researcher and physician who discovered ABO blood types in 1900, thereby enabling safe blood transfusion. Also, together with Alexander Wiener in 1937, he discovered the Rh antigen and three years later the role of Rh in pregnancy complications resulting from the mismatch between Rh typing of a mother and her fetus.$LANL	[acronym]  Los Alamos National Laboratory$Laplace, Pierre-Simon	[person]  French mathematician and astronomer born in Normandy, France (1749-1827). Laplace made significant contributions in mathematics and error quantification and is credited with founding the field of mathematical astronomy. In addition, he predicted the existence of black holes and the concept of gravitational collapse.$lattice	[noun]  A characteristic pattern formed by the spatial distribution of repeating units.$Lavoisier, Antoine	[person]  French chemist, born in Paris (1743-1794). He is famous for proving that air is composed of several gases.

He worked primarily on celestial mechanics and, like John Couch Adams, predicted the existence of Neptune based on perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. He also, incorrectly, predicted the existence of a planet inside the orbit of Mercury, which he named Vulcan, based on perturbations in Mercury's orbit.$leaching	[verb]  Dissolving out by the action of a percolating liquid.$Leclerc, Georges	[person]  French mathematician, naturalist, and biologist, born in Montbard, CÃ´te-d'Or (1707-1788). In 1727, Leclerc discovered the binomial theorem. In the 1730s, he published MÃ©moire sur le jeu de franc-carreau (Thesis on the game of franc-carreau), which combined differential and integral calculus with probability theory. His most famous works are in natural history, where his ideas influenced the thinking of Lamarck and Darwin. His great work, Histoire naturelle, gÃ©nÃ©rale et particuliÃ¨re (General and specific natural history) consists of 36 volumes, published in 1749-1778, plus 8 more volumes published after his death.$Lehmann, Inge	[person]  Danish physicist born in Osterbro by the Lakes (1888-1993). In 1925, Lehmann became interested in seismology while working as assistant to Professor N.E. Norlund. Three years later, she was appointed chief of the seismological department at the Royal Geodetic Institute. Because Denmark is seismically stable, Lehmann focused her research on small earthquakes and explosions and the microseismic wave motions generated by Arctic and North Sea storms. From refractions of seismic waves, she discovered the Earth's inner core in 1936. In 1971, Lehmann was awarded the Bowie Medal by the American Geophysical Union for her contributions to the fields of seismology and Earth science.$lenticular	[adjective]  Shaped like a lens, of or related to a lens; often referring to clouds, galaxies, rock bodies, or small features within rocks.$leukocytes	[noun]  Nearly colorless cells of the immune system that circulate mainly in the blood and lymph. Leukocytes participate in the immune system's reactions to invading microorganisms or foreign particles.$Levene, Phoebus	[person]  (February 25, 1869 - September 6, 1940) A Russian-American biochemist who studied the structure and function of nucleic acids, differentiated DNA and RNA (the two types of nucleic acid), and discovered that DNA consists of adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine, deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. Levene is remembered for his "tetranucleotide hypothesis," which he formulated around 1910 and which stated that DNA was composed of equal amounts of adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. Levene thought that DNA was too simple a molecule to carry genetic information, and favored the hypothesis that genetic material was stored instead in protein. Despite his misconceptions, his work contributed greatly to the eventual discovery of the importance of DNA.$Lewis, Gilbert Newton	[person]  American chemist born in Weymouth, Massachusetts (1875-1946). Lewis's early work, carried out as a faculty member at MIT, involved the determination of electrode potentials of elements, conductivity, and thermodynamics. Most of his later work focused on thermodynamics and chemical equilibrium, electron-pair bonding of atoms and molecules, isotopes, and light-matter interactions. During his 34-year tenure at UC Berkeley, Lewis was renowned as a remarkable teacher and advisor. In 1923 he published Valence and the Structure of Atoms and Molecules, still considered a classic work and a vital contribution to modern bonding theory.$lichen	[noun]  Fungi that live symbiotically with photosynthetic algae or bacteria.$light	[noun]  A form of electromagnetic radiation.  Visible light is that associated with stimulating the organs of sight, which for normal human vision ranges in wavelength from 3900 to 7700 Ã¥ngstroms.$limestone	[noun]  A sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcite (CaCO3). Limestone forms through chemical precipitation in warm, shallow seas, and often contains marine fossils.$limiting factor	[noun]  The essential resource an organism needs for life that is in shortest supply in their environment. In environmental science, this usually means the resource (e.g., food supply, water supply, air to breathe) that is limiting the growth of an organism or population within a given ecosystem.  For example, the number of fish that can survive in an aquarium depends on the amount of food, dissolved oxygen, and space available. If there is enough space and oxygen, but not enough food, the fish population will decrease. The individual organisms will only be able to survive as long as their basic needs for life are met. The factor that is in least supply is limiting the growth of the organism and/or population.$limiting nutrient	[noun]  An essential nutrient an organism needs for life that is in the shortest supply in their environment. For example, a tomato plant requires specific amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to grow and produce fruit. A soil sample from a garden shows adequate amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, but a very low amount of potassium. Potassium is the limiting nutrient in this instance because the tomato plants do not have enough potassium to perform the cellular processes needed for growth and reproduction. Growth will continue if more potassium is added to the soil. The nutrient in least supply is limiting the organismâs ability to grow and reproduce.$limiting reactant	[noun]  A reactant that limits the amount of product produced in a chemical reaction.$limnologist	[noun]  A scientist whose focus is the study of inland water bodies (e.g., lakes, rivers, streams) and their surrounding environment. This includes the interactions between the plants and animals in and around the water bodies, as well as the effect of geology (e.g., topography, soils) and weather. Limnology includes the study of inland salt-water bodies, like the Lochs of Scotland and Great Salt Lake in Utah, as well as freshwater bodies.$line spectra	[noun]  An emission spectrum of light that contains very sharply defined lines. Line spectra are given off when matter is heated or excited in some way, and each line corresponds to a wavelength of light given off during an electron transition from an excited state to the ground state.$Line, Francis	[person]  An English Jesuit scientist (1595 â 1675). Line championed Aristotleâs idea that ânature abhors a vacuumâ in the 17th century, and therefore proposed the idea of âfuniculus,â a substance that materializes to extinguish a vacuum. The existence of funiculus was disproven by Robert Boyle in the mid-17th century.$lineage	[noun]  In organisms, lineage is the line of descent from an ancestor.$linear equation	[adjective]  An equation that makes a straight line when plotted on a graph.$linear momentum	 Also called momentum, it is the product of an objectâs mass and velocity, represented by a vector quantity. Units are often in kg Â· m/s.$linear regression	[noun]  A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The stronger the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, the closer they will fall on a straight line when plotted against one another. Also see correlation.$Linnaean hierarchy	[noun]  The seven major categories of biological classification based on Linnaeusâ system: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.$Linnaeus, Carolus	[person]  (also Carl Linnaeus or Karl von LinnÃ©) Swedish physician, naturalist, and taxonomist born in Stenbrohult (1707-1778). Inspired by the work of John Ray, Linnaeus developed a system for classifying organisms, a modified version of which is still in use. In 1735, he published the first edition of Systema Naturae, which detailed his classification system. He was also the physician to the Royal Family of Sweden.$Linus, Franciscus	[person]  An English Jesuit scientist, born Francis Line (1595 â 1675). Linus championed Aristotleâs idea that ânature abhors a vacuumâ in the 17th century, and therefore proposed the idea of âfuniculus,â a substance that materializes to extinguish a vacuum. The existence of funiculus was disproven by Robert Boyle in the mid-17th century.$lipids	[noun]  A diverse group of organic molecules that contain long hydrocarbon chains or rings and are hydrophobic. Examples are fats, oils, waxes, and steroids.$liquid	[noun]  The state of matter characterized by its condensed nature and ability to flow. Unlike gases, molecules within a liquid often experience some type of intermolecular interaction. Unlike solids, liquids do not have fixed shapes and take the shape of their container (as do gases). Compare with gas and solid.$lithosphere	[noun]  The rigid upper layer of Earth consisting of the crust and the upper mantle. Earthâs tectonic plates are composed of pieces of the lithosphere. The lithosphere ranges in thickness from 10-12 km underneath the oceans to 70-200 km at the continents.$London dispersion force	[noun]  An intermolecular force between temporary dipoles, where opposite charges created by temporary uneven distribution of electrons interact favorably.$Los Alamos National Laboratory	[organization]  One of 17 national laboratories overseen by the US Department of Energy.

Today, the focus of research at LANL is national security and nuclear deterrence.$Loschmidt, Johann Josef	[person]  Austrian chemist and physicist, born in Pocerny (now part of the Czech Republic) (1821-1895). He worked in thermodynamics, optics, and electrodynamics. One of his many contributions to science was the accurate calculation of the average size of the gas molecules that make up air.$Lovelock, James	[person]  British chemist, born in Letchworth Garden City (1919-). He developed the Gaia Hypothesis, which proposes that the biosphere and all physical components of Earth are coupled together in a complexly interacting system. The hypothesis is frequently paraphrased as describing Earth as a single living organism. Lovelock was also an inventor: His most famous invention is the electron capture detector, which provided valuable information on the distribution of halogen-bearing chemicals and CFCs in the atmosphere.$lunar eclipse	[noun]  A celestial event occurring when the moon passes through some portion of Earth's shadow. This only occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon are aligned so that Earth is between the sun and moon.$luster	[noun]  The way an object reflects light; sheen, gloss.$Lyell, Charles	[person]  A British geologist born in Scotland (1797-1875 CE). His most important work was The Principles of Geology: An Attempt to Explain the Former Changes of the Earth's Surface by Reference to Causes Now in Operation. Lyell championed the theory of uniformitarianism, which states that the same processes we see on Earth today were active throughout the past and shaped the Earth as we know it, including slow processes like sedimentation. This opposed the leading view at that time, catastrophism, which states that changes to the Earth's surface occur in sudden, discrete events. He also wrote Elements of Geology, which is still considered a seminal work on stratigraphy and paleontology. His third major, though now lesser known, work was The Antiquity of Man, in which he supports Darwin's theories regarding the origins of species. The Lyell Medal is now awarded yearly by the Council of the Geological Society to a significant contemporary geologist. For further information, see our module The Rock Cycle.$lymphocyte	[noun]  Second most abundant type of white blood cell in the blood of vertebrates.$MacLeod, Colin	[person]  (January 28, 1909 - February 11, 1972) A Canadian-American geneticist. He received his MD from McGill University in 1932, at the age of 23. Working with Oswald Avery and Maclyn McCarty, MacLeod showed that changes in the form or function of bacteria are caused by changes in DNA. The Avery-McCarty-MacLeod experiment was vital in the discovery that genetic material is contained in DNA, not in protein. Later in life, MacLeod became involved in health issues related to the Second World War, such as the microbial diseases typhus fever, malaria, and pneumonia, which posed serious threats to military personnel.$macronutrient	[noun]  Nutrients that are needed in high amounts to sustain life. For example, plants need a high amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in order to grow and reproduce. See also: limiting nutrient and micronutrient.$macroscopic	[adjective]  That which is observable by the unaided eye. Many scientific disciplines explore both large-scale (macroscopic) and tiny (microscopic) properties to fully understand phenomena and organisms. Contrast with microscopic.$Magellan, Ferdinand	[person]  (Portuguese: FernÃ£o de MagalhÃ£es, ca. 1480 - April 27, 1521) A Portuguese explorer who became a Spanish national so that he could search for a westward route to the Spice Islands (modern Indonesia) for King Charles of Spain. Magellan's expedition of 1519 - 1522 was the first to sail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and the first to cross the Pacific. The expedition completed a circumnavigation of the globe, but Magellan was killed in battle in the Philippines. Magellan named the Pacific Ocean (from Latin, meaning the peaceful ocean), which he reached via what he named the Straits of Magellan. He also named the Magellanic penguin; he was the first European to describe it. He is remembered as one of the great explorers, and the Magellanic clouds, nearby dwarf galaxies visible from the southern hemisphere are named after him.$magma	[noun]  Molten rock below the surface of the Earth.$magnetic moment	[noun]  A measure of an object's interaction with an external magnetic field. A magnet, an electron, and a planet all have magnetic moments. For particles, the magnetic moment is caused  by the spin and charge of the object.$magnetism	 Forces of attraction or repulsion between objects.$magnitude	[noun]  Magnitude is a number assigned to a quantity and refers to the size or extent of something. There are several differing scientific uses of the term. In physics, it refers to the quantity of a measurement such as length, in astronomy it may refer to the brightness of a star, while in geology, it can indicate the strength of an earthquake.$malleability	[noun]  The extent to which a solid can be hammered into a sheet without breaking. Metallic solids generally have high malleability.$Malthus, Thomas Robert	[person]  English ordained minister and economist born in Dorking, Surrey (1766-1834). In 1798 he published his Essay on Population, suggesting that a given population will always exceed its food supply, and it would therefore be counterproductive to provide starving populations with food. Instead, he argued, social equality must be achieved through other means, such as universal suffrage and state-funded education for the poor.$Manhattan Project	[noun]  A United States project initiated in August 1942 that was responsible for developing atomic technology, and specifically an atomic bomb, during World War II.$manipulation	[noun]  The act of purposely controlling, changing, or adapting one aspect or condition in an experiment.$mantle	[noun]  The middle portion of the interior of the Earth, starting below the crust at 5-70 km below the Earthâs surface and continuing to a depth of 2900 km. The mantle is composed mainly of the rock peridotite.$manuscript	[noun]  An article or other document submitted or considered for publication.$mass	[noun]  A fundamental property of matter which is a numerical measure of the inertia of an object or the amount of matter that an object contains.  The mass of an object is different from its weight as mass is independent of the gravitational field exerted on an object.$mass spectrometer	[noun]  A spectrometer that measures the composition of samples by analyzing the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of components in the sample. To do this, the sample introduced into the spectrometer is ionized under high energy, and the various ions are then separated in a magnetic field and measured. The specific m/z signature of each ion is then used to identify the parent element or compound.$maternal	[adjective]  Derived from or related to one's mother.$mathematical modeling	[verb]  The process of analyzing and describing real-life situations using appropriate mathematics and statistics.  Modeling is often used to express a situation as an equation and to use the equation to better understand the situation and make better future decisions about it.$matter	[noun]  The substance that makes up physical objects.$Matthews, Drummond	[person]  English marine geophysicist, born in Porlock, Somerset (1931-1997). In 1962, Matthews participated in the International Indian Ocean Expedition and made a detailed survey of a submarine ridge that showed that the pattern of magnetic polarity of seafloor rocks surrounding the ridge was symmetric. This discovery contributed to the widespread acceptance of the plate tectonic theory. He also studied the structure and evolution of continental crust using deep crustal seismics.$Maury, Matthew	[person]  (1806-1873) American naval officer and chronicler of winds, currents, and other observations. Maury led the effort to standardize meteorological observations so that they could be shared and compiled more easily. He is best known for his publication, The Physical Geography of the Sea and its Meteorology, first published in 1855.$maximum depth	[noun]  In aquatic sciences, the deepest part of a specified area, such as a lake or gulf. Depth is an important factor in aquatic systems because it influences the water bodyâs overall  temperature, water volume, and its ability to sustain plant and animal life. Shallow ponds, for example, will be warmer overall than deeper ponds in the same geographical region because they have a greater surface area/depth ratio, and so the available sunlight warms the water to a greater extent.$Maxwell, James Clerk	[person]  Scottish theoretical physicist and mathematician born in Edinburgh (1831-1879). Maxwell developed the classical electromagnetic theory, which synthesized previously unrelated observations, experiments, and equations of electricity and magnetism. In 1864, Maxwell wrote A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field, in which he proposed that light is a wave. He also described what is now known as Maxwellian distribution, a statistical way of describing the kinetic theory of gases.$mb	[noun]  The abbreviation for millibar.$McCarty, Maclyn	[person]  (June 9, 1911 - January 2, 2005) An American physician and geneticist who specialized in infectious diseases. McCarty is remembered for discovering, with Oswald Avery and Colin MacLeod, that DNA is responsible for changes in form and function of bacteria. McCarty's later work focused on rheumatic fever and its relationship to the Streptococcus bacteria, and he pioneered the now-standard medical practice of using protein levels in blood to measure rheumatic inflammation.$mean	[noun]  In statistics, mean commonly refers to the arithmetic mean, also called the average, which is one measure of the mid-point of a dataset. The mean and median approach one another in datasets that approach a normal distribution, but can differ substantially in datasets with skewed distributions. Compare to median. The mean is calculated by obtaining the sum of the values in a dataset and dividing that sum by the number of data points, as in the formulas shown.$mean free path	[noun]  The average distance a particle moves between impacts with other particles.$mechanical	[adjective]  Involving physical force or motion.$Medawar, Peter	[person]  English biologist and essayist born in Brazil (1915-1987).

With Sir Frank MacFarlane Burnet, Medawar won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1960 "for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance"; Medawar's work concerned skin grafting and other organ transplants in humans. In his later years, he became a prolific author about the nature of science, and is well known for his essays "The Art of the Soluble" and "The Phenomenon of Man."$median	[noun]  In statistics, the median is the value separating the upper half from the lower half of a dataset. In other words, it is the middle value of the data when they are arranged in order of magnitude. The median is a characteristic of a dataset comparable to the mean. The median and mean approach one another in datasets that approach the normal distribution, but can differ substantially in datasets with skewed distributions. Compare to mean.$megaparsec	[noun]  (Mpc) A numerical value of distance in space. 1 Mpc = 1 million paresecs, where one parsec equals 3.26 light years, or ~19 trillion miles.$meiosis	[noun]  Process, occurring in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, in which a single cell divides twice, yielding four cells, also called gametes, each of which is haploid (it contains half the genome of the organism). In males, gametes produced are called sperm, whereas gametes produced by females are called ova, or eggs.$melanin	[noun]  The pigment responsible for darker skin tones.$melting point	[noun]  The temperature at which a compound is transformed from its solid state to its liquid state, and where the solid and liquid states exist in equilibrium. During the transition from solid to liquid, the energy put into the system goes to changing the compoundâs state, not increasing the temperature, so the temperature remains constant until the solid is completely melted.$membrane	[noun]  A thin layer of tissue that forms a boundary of a cell or cell part.$membrane pump	[noun]  Proteins embedded in the plasma membrane of a cell that pump specific molecules or ions into or out of the cell.$Mendel, Gregor	[person]  Austrian Augustinian monk and scientist born in Heizendorf (now Hynice, Chech Republic) (1822-1884). In 1865, Mendel wrote Versuche Ã¼ber Pflanzen-Hybride (Treatises on Plant Hybrids), which detailed his observations on the inheritance of various traits in cross-bred pea plants and presented his principles of hereditary transmission. Unfortunately, the importance of his work was not recognized until after his death.$Mendeleev, Dmitri	[person]  Russian inventor and chemist born in Tobolsk, Siberia (1834-1907). Mendeleev's most famous work is the development of the periodic table of elements, and his prediction of properties of elements that were, at that time, not yet discovered. In 1869, Mendeleev helped found the Russian Chemical Society. He researched in many fields, including physics, hydrodynamics, meteorology, and chemical technology.$mesosphere	[noun]  1. The lowermost portion of the mantle. 2. The layer of the atmosphere above the stratosphere, where temperature decreases with altitude.$metabolism	[noun]  A sequence of biochemical reactions in living organisms that converts food into energy used to drive other biological processes. Also, the sequence of transformations foreign compounds undergo inside a living cell.$metallic bond	[noun]  A bond between two metal atoms. Metallic bonds are strong and non-directional, meaning that it is hard to separate metal atoms but they can move and remain bonded as long as some parts of their surfaces are in contact. The outer electrons are relatively free to move between bonded metal atoms.$metamorphic	[adjective]  Formed through the processes involved in metamorphism, which include deep burial, exposure to high temperatures and pressures, and interactions with hydrothermal fluids. Metamorphic rocks are generally considered to have a parent rock, or protolith, which can be any rock type. The minerals and textures that are produced through metamorphism are indicative of both the protolith and the metamorphic environment.$metamorphism	[noun]  Physical and chemical changes to rocks that occur below the Earth's surface. These changes are caused by increased temperature, increased pressure, and the presence of hydrothermal fluids, and result in the growth and reorientation of crystals in the rock. Metamorphism does not include melting - once magma forms, the resulting rock will be igneous.$meteorology	[noun]  The scientific study of the atmosphere including the processes that cause particular weather conditions.$method	[noun]  A procedure or process; a systematic way of performing a task or conducting research.$methodology	[noun]  A set of procedures or methods of inquiry used in a particular field of study.$Michell, John	[person]  English natural philosopher and geologist, born in Nottinghamshire (1724-1793).

He also demonstrated radiation pressure, adding support to Christian Huygens' argument that light consists of waves.$Michelson, Albert	[person]  American physicist, born in Strelno, Prussia (1852-1931). He is remembered for his work in optics, particularly for his early, extremely accurate experiments to determine the velocity of light. Michelson invented the interferometer, which he used to determine the effect of Earth's motion on the observed velocity of light. He was also interested in astronomy, and, using his interferometer, accurately measured the diameter of the star Betelgeuse. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 1907.$microbial	[adjective]  Relating to microorganisms such as bacteria.$microfossil	[noun]  A fossil so small that it must be studied by using a microscope.$micronutrient	[noun]  Nutrients that are needed to grow and reproduce, but in small amounts. For example, plants need boron in order to develop fruits and seeds. However, the amount of boron needed to perform this function is much less than the amount of nitrogen the plant needs to perform photosynthesis. In humans, supplements generally labeled as vitamins fall into the micronutrient category. See also: limiting nutrient and macronutrient.$microscopic	[adjective]  That which cannot be seen with the unaided eye and requires a tool (such as a microscope) to view. Many scientific disciplines explore both large-scale (macroscopic) and tiny (microscopic) properties to fully understand phenomena and organisms. Contrast with macroscopic .$microtubule	[noun]  Microtubules are hollow cylinders of tubulin protein in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. As part of a cell's cytoskeleton, they shape and support it. Microtubules are also involved in the transport of materials inside of the cell. They serve as paths along which organelles with motor-equipped molecules can move. Microtubules participate in the separation of chromosomes during cell division (mitosis) and can act alone or form such complex structures as flagella and cilia.$mid-ocean ridge	[noun]  A linear, elevated region of the ocean floor where magma is upwelling and extruding, and new crust is forming. The ridges are often referred to by their more specific names: Mid-Atlantic Ridge, East Pacific Rise, etc.$Middle Ages	[noun]  European history from the 5th century to the 15th century. The Middle Ages follow the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and are marked by depopulation, migration from urban centers, and increasing frequency of barbarian invasions. Key events include the Crusades, during which Europeans attempted to recapture the Holy Land, and the development of the serf system, which enabled systematic agriculture to begin again. Agriculture was widely affected due to climate change, resulting in frequent famines. In addition, the Black Death (which may have been the bubonic plague) spread rapidly across Europe, killing 30-60% of the population by the mid-14th century. With the resulting decrease in the labor force, due to death by disease or hunger, landlords were forced to offer higher wages to entice peasants to work in their fields. The end of the Middle Ages is generally considered to be 1453, the date of the Turks' conquest of Constantinople.$Miescher, J. Friedrich	[person]  A Swiss physician and biologist (1844 - 1895). An attack of typhoid fever left him partially deaf, and he felt this would be a disadvantage as a doctor, so he decided to pursue physiological chemistry instead. He is remembered for isolating nucleic acids from white blood cells, one of many steps that made possible the discovery that DNA carries genetic material. In addition, Meischer proved that breathing is regulated by carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood.$millibar	[noun]  A unit of measurement of atmospheric pressure equivalent to 1 gram per square centimeter. Average sea level pressure is 1013 mb, equivalent to one Atmosphere.$mineral	[noun]  A naturally formed, inorganic solid with a specific chemical composition and characteristic crystal structure.

In mitosis, chromosomes in the cell nucleus separate into two identical chromosome sets, the two sets are separated, and two independent nuclei form, each with its own set of chromosomes matching that of the parent nucleus. Mitosis consists of five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.$model	[noun]  A representation, pattern, or mathematical description that can help scientists replicate a system.$Moho	[noun]  The commonly used abbreviation of the Mohorovicic Discontinuity, the boundary between the crust and the mantle.$Mohorovičić, Andrija	[person]  Croatian meteorologist and geophysicst born in Volosko (1857-1921). In 1901, Mohorovičić was appointed head on the meteorological service of Croatia and Slavonia. He upgraded the services to European standards, and expanded the work of the observatory into seismology, geomagnetism, and gravitation. Mohorovičić discovered the existence of S and P seismic waves, which propagate through the Earth at different velocities. From seismic refractions, Mohorovičić discovered a discontinuity between the less dense rocks of the crust and denser rocks of the mantle, now called the Mohorovičić discontinuity (known more commonly as the Moho).$Mohorovicic Discontinuity	[noun]  The boundary within the Earth between the crust and the mantle, as indicated by the refraction and velocity change of seismic waves recognized by Andrija Mohorovičić. The depth of the Mohorovicic Discontinuity is ~5-7 km below oceanic crust and ~10-70 km below continental crust.$Mohs, Friedrich	[person]  German geologist and mineralogist born in Gernrode (1773-1839). In 1802, after studying at the Mining Academy in Freiberg, Saxony, Mohs moved Austria, where he was hired to identify minerals in a private collection.

His work is somewhat obscure today, in part because he only published one work, Opera Geometrica.$trachyte	[noun]  A fine-grained volcanic rock consisting predominantly of alkali feldspar and one or more subordinate minerals, generally hornblende or mica.$trait	[noun]  A specific characteristic that is genetically determined.$transform boundary	[noun]  A plate boundary where two plates are sliding past each other.$transition	[noun]  A change from one stage, form, or state to another.$transmutation	[noun]  The transformation of one element into another through nuclear decay or nuclear reaction.$transpiration	[noun]  The transfer of water vapor into the air from plants, often called evapotranspiration.$treatment	[noun]  In science, a treatment refers to a method for fixing or manipulating an independent variable in the course of scientific research. For more information, see our module Experimentation in Scientific Research.$trench	[noun]  In plate tectonics, trenches are tremendously deep features on the ocean floor â deep valleys that reach as far as 11 km below sea level. These trenches are the edge of subduction zones, where one plate is diving beneath another.Â Â $trigonometry	[noun]  The branch of mathematics that deals with the relations between angles and the length of the sides of a triangle, and can apply to calculations of circles and waves.$tropopause	[noun]  The boundary between the stratosphere and the troposphere in Earthâs atmosphere, where atmospheric temperature stops decreasing with increasing altitude. The tropopause is located at the highest altitude of 16-18 km near the tropics and decreases to an altitude of 7-9 km near the poles.$troposphere	[noun]  The lowermost 12-18 km of the atmosphere, where temperature decreases about 6.5 degrees Celsius per kilometer of altitude. Wind, precipitation, and the jet stream all occur within the troposphere.$Tyndall, John	[person]  Irish physicist born at Leighlin Bridge, County Carlow (1820-1893). Tyndall was one of the first scientists to recognize the natural greenhouse effect and to identify the relative importance of various greenhouse gases. He also showed that ozone is an oxygen cluster (O3), not a hydrogen compound. In addition, Tyndall was a prolific inventor, devising a respirator for firefighters, the foghorn, and the light pipe, which was the progenitor of fiber optics.$Tyson, Edward	[person]  English physician born in Clevedon, Somerset (1650-1708). His most famous work was Orang-Outang, sive Homo Sylvestris; or, the Anatomy of a Pygmie Compared with that of a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man. He was physician and governor of the first mental hospital in Britain, the Bethlem Hospital in London, and is considered to be the founder of comparative anatomy.$ultraviolet	[adjective]  Wavelengths between 1 and 380 nanometers (nm) on the electromagnetic spectrum, falling between X-rays (10-2 nm to 1 nm) and visible light (380 nm to 780 nm).  Ultraviolet, or UV, radiation causes sunburn and certain skin cancers.$uncertainty	[noun]  The quantitative estimation of error, which indicates the precision of a measurement or value. All measurements include some amount of uncertainty generated through a combination of systematic and random error. See our module Uncertainty, Error, and Confidence.$uniformitarianism	[noun]  The fundamental geological principle that the processes that are operating now to shape the world around us have been operating throughout the geologic past as well. This principle was first proposed by James Hutton in the mid-1700s, and implied that the Earth had to be billions of years old to create all of the rocks and structures we see today. Importantly, uniformitarianism does not require that all changes happen at the same rate; some processes are slow, like the deposition of sediment in deltas, others are fast, like volcanic eruptions. This principle is often paraphrased as "The present is the key to the past."$unit	[noun]  An accepted quantity used as a standard of measurement. For example, the meter, liter, and gram.$universe	[noun]  The cosmos and everything that exists in it.$uropygial gland	[noun]  A gland on the back at the base of the tail in most birds that secretes an oily fluid used by the bird in preening and waterproofing its feathers.$vaccine	[noun]  A preparation of a weakened or killed pathogen, such as a bacterium or virus, or of a portion of the pathogen's structure that is used to stimulate immunity to a particular disease or antibody production.$valence	[noun]  The number of single bonds an atom can form, also measured as the number of hydrogen atoms that typically bond to an atom of an element. For example, in H2O, oxygen has a valence of two; in CH4, carbon has a valence of four.$valence electron	[noun]  Electrons that can be actively involved in chemical change; usually electrons in the shell with the highest value of n (electrons in the "outermost" shell of an atom). For example, sodium's ground state electron configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1; the 3s electron is the only valence electron in the atom. Valence electrons determine the chemical properties of an atom and are the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding.$valence shell	[noun]  The outermost electron shell of an atom that contains electrons.$validate	[verb]  To establish the soundness or truth of something, often using an independent means of checking results. Validation of data, models, statistical analyses, etc. is a key component of the process of science.$value	[noun]  A number that is assigned based on measurement or a calculation. In mathematics, an unknown value that is commonly represented by x or y.$van der Waals force	[noun]  A general term for all attractive forces that occur between electrically neutral molecules.  Van der Waals forces include dipole-to-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and other intermolecular forces.$variable	[noun]  In math, an expression that can be assigned any set of values. Variables are written as symbols, such as x, y or z, representing unspecified quantities or members of a set.

In science, the term refers to a condition or parameter that may be manipulated, fixed, measured, or observed in the course of scientific research. There are usually three categories of  variables in science experiments; control, independent (experimental) and dependent (response). For more information, see our module Experimentation in Scientific Research.$vein	[noun]  One of the systems of branching vessels conveying deoxygenated blood from various parts of the body to the heart.$velocity	[noun]  The speed at which an object is traveling, measured in distance per unit time (for example meters per second or m/s). Compare to acceleration.$Venter, Craig	[person]  (born 1946) American geneticist and entrepreneur, renown for leading the charge to sequence the human genome.

In 1998, he started Celera Genomics, a privately funded company, to pursue genome projects.$vertebrate	[noun]  Any organism with a backbone. Only ~5% of described animal species are vertebrates.$vesicle	[noun]  A small, self-enclosed sac inside of cells containing fluid and other material. The vesicles organize the cell's metabolism, help store enzymes in the cell, and serve a transport function by moving molecules between locations within the cell. Vesicles are also used as containers to isolate damaging chemical reactions from occurring in the cytosol.$villi	[noun]  (singular: villus) Small protrusions or bumps, usually on the surface of a membrane, that increase its surface area.$Vine, Frederick	[person]  English geophysicist, born in London (1939-). With his advisor, Drummond Matthews, Vine wrote "Magnetic Anomalies Over Ocean Ridges," presenting ideas that helped the theory of plate tectonics gain widespread recognition and adherents. Vine also researched the history of Earth's magnetic field and studied the electrical conductivity of the lower continental crust.$Virchow, Karl	[person]  Polish biologist, born in Scievelbein, Pommerania (today Swindin, Poland) (1821-1902). In 1858 he published his best-known work, The Foundation of Cellular Pathology on the Basis of a Physiological and Pathological Understanding of Tissue, formalizing the cell theory.$virus	[noun]  An ultramicroscopic infectious agent that can only replicate within the cells of living hosts, mainly bacteria, plants, and animals. Viruses have a very basic structure, consisting of an RNA or DNA core surrounded by a protein coat. More complex viruses also have an envelope surrounding the core and protein coat. Viruses have a wide range of effects on their hosts, from nearly harmless (such as toxoplasmosis in cats) to fatal (such as Ebola in humans).$viscosity	[verb]  The measurement of a fluid's resistance to shear or flow. Highly viscous fluids resist motion due to their molecular composition that produce internal friction. Honey, for example, is a fluid with a high viscosity.  Low viscosity fluids, conversely, flow easily because their molecular composition results in very little friction.$viscous	[adjective]  Used to describe substances that are gluey in character and are in between a solid and fluid.$visibility	[noun]  The distance the human eye can see through a given medium, such as air or water, under certain environmental conditions.

In aquatic sciences, visibility is usually measured in meters with a Secchi disc. Visibility in water can be an indication of water turbulence. As water moves within a given area, it stirs up sediment and nutrients that have settled onto the areaâs bottom â an action similar to shaking a snow globe. Visibility can also be an indication of how much productivity is occurring in the aquatic system. For example, all other variables being equal, a pond that is rich in plant and animal life will likely have a lower visibility than a pond that has very little life. This is because there are more plankton and particulate matter in the water column of the pond rich in life â similar to the difference between looking down a crowded street and looking down the same street when it is empty of people.$volume	[noun]  The amount of space taken up by matter, commonly expressed in cubic centimeters (cm3) or milliliters (ml).$von Seysenegg, Erich Tschermak	[person]  (November 15, 1871 â October 11, 1962) An Austrian agronomist whose research focused on developing disease-resistant crops, such as wheat-rye and oat hybrids. In 1900, von Seysenegg published a paper presenting his rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work on genetics.$Wallace, Alfred Russel	[person]  English naturalist, geographer, and anthropologist, born in Monmouthshire (1823-1913). Wallace's most important work was in the Malay Archipelago (now the Indonesian Archipelago), where he spent 8 years collecting specimens and making observations. During this time he published the essays "On the Law Which Has Regulated the Introduction of New Species" and "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type," in which he introduced the idea of evolution through natural selection.$water-insoluble	[adjective]  Unable to be dissolved in water.$Watson, James	[person]  American molecular biologist born in Chicago, Illinois (1928-). His early work focused on bacterial viruses, but he is  best known for his contributions to determining the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 (at the young age of 25). For this work, Watson shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962 with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins.$wave function	[noun]  A function that satisfies a wave equation and describes the properties of a wave. In quantum physics, a mathematical function (Ψ), described by the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, that is used to describe all possible states of a fundamental particle. While the wave function cannot be measured directly, its square is a real number that can be measured, and which corresponds to the probability of finding a particle at a particular location.$wave period	[noun]  The time, measured in seconds, required for a given point on a wave to complete one full cycle of its motion, such as from crest to crest. Represented by the symbol T.$wave-particle duality	[noun]  The concept that predicts that every elementary particle will exhibit the characteristics and properties of both a wave and a particle.$wavelength	[noun]  The distance between corresponding points on two successive waves, generally measured from crest to crest.$waves	[noun]  The motion of rising and falling in curves; undulation.$wean	[verb]  To accustom a young animal to food other than its mother's milk. In farming, young animals are intentionally weaned early so that the mother's milk may be harvested for human consumption. Human children are generally fully weaned at around 2 years of age.$weathering	[noun]  The destructive processes that change the physical and chemical characteristics of rocks at the earth's surface. Physical breakdown of large rocks into smaller rocks is called mechanical weathering; changes in a rock's composition due to exposure to the atmosphere and water is called chemical weathering.$Wegener, Alfred	[person]  German astronomer, meteorologist, and geophysicist born in Berlin (1880-1930). Wegener pioneered the use of balloons to track air circulation and wrote a meteorology textbook that became the standard in Germany. His most famous work is the theory of continental drift, which he developed based on how the coastlines of Africa and South America fit together. In 1915, Wegener published his theory in The Origins of Continents and Oceans. Despite additional evidence for this theory (including the continuity of geologic formations and fossil distributions in now widely-separated continents), it did not gain acceptance in the scientific community until the 1960s, long after his death.$weight	[noun]  A measure of the force exerted on an object by a gravitational field. The weight of an object equals its mass times the force of gravity: w=m*g.$Wilkins, Maurice	[person]  British physicist born in Pongaroa, New Zealand (1916-2004). Wilkins early work on phosphorescence led to his participation in the Manhattan Project and the development of better radar systems during World War II. After the war, Wilkins shifted his attention to biophysics and the X-ray diffraction patterns caused by DNA and other biological materials. Wilkins shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Medicine with James Watson and Francis Crick for their work on the structure of DNA.$Wilson, J. Tuzo	[person]  Canadian geophysicst, born in Ottawa, Ontario (1908-1993). Wilson is best known for proposing the hotspot hypothesis to explain island chains such as Hawaii. This hypothesis bolstered the theory of plate tectonics by resolving the issue of how active volcanoes could exist far from plate boundaries. He also proposed the existence of transform plate boundaries, where plates meet in transform faults such as the San Andreas.$WMO	[acronym]  World Meteorological Organization$work	[noun]  A process that occurs when a force acts over a distance, as when an object is moved. Work equals the multiple of the applied force by distance: W = F*d.  Work can be thought of as a process in which one form of energy is transformed into another and is commonly expressed in units of joules.$World Meteorological Organization	[organization]  A specialized agency of the United Nations that acts as an authoritative voice on the Earth's atmosphere. More information about the WMO can be found at their website: http://www.wmo.int/$Wren, Christopher	[person]  An English scientist (1632-1723) appointed as the Gresham Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge at the young age of 25. Wren was instrumental in the establishment of the Royal Society of London as one of the first scientific institutions and also made his name as an architect, particularly in the renovation of historic buildings in London after the Great Fire of 1666.$x-axis	[noun]  The line on a graph that runs horizontally (left to right).$X-ray	[noun]  A form of electromagnetic radiation with higher frequency and energy than any other electromagnetic radiation besides gamma rays. X-rays have various applications, including medical imaging and X-ray crystallography, but can also damage material they come into contact with because of their high energy.$X-ray crystallography	[noun]  A technique used to determine the structure and identities of atoms in a compound by exposing a solid crystal of the compound to X-rays and analyzing how the crystal diffracts the X-rays.$X-ray diffraction	[noun]  A technique used to determine the arrangement of the atoms in a crystal.$y-axis	[noun]  The line on a graph that runs vertically (bottom to top).$yeast	[noun]  Eukaryotic, single-celled organisms belonging to the fungi kingdom.$Young, Thomas	[person]  English physicist and physician, born in Milverton, Somerset (1773-1829).
